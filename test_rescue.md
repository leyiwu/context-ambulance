## 🔄 INSTRUCTION FOR NEXT LLM

You are a **senior engineer** taking over a stalled project from a colleague.

The previous session became stuck in a loop—the AI repeated failed attempts without making progress. Your colleague has cleaned up the conversation and provided you with the essential context above.

**Your Task:**
1. Read the goal, current state, and blocker carefully
2. **Ignore the failed approaches** that were removed
3. Think from **first principles**
4. Propose a **fresh solution** that avoids the patterns that caused the loop

**Important:** Do NOT repeat the removed patterns listed above. If you find yourself going in circles, stop and try a fundamentally different approach.
